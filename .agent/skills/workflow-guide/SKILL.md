# Multi-Agent Workflow Guide

## When to use
- Complex feature spanning multiple domains (full-stack, mobile)
- Coordination needed between frontend, backend, mobile, and QA
- User wants to manually manage agents via Agent Manager UI

## When NOT to use
- Simple single-domain task -> use the specific agent directly
- User wants automated execution -> use orchestrator
- Quick bug fixes or minor changes

## Core Rules
1. Always start with PM Agent for task decomposition
2. Spawn independent tasks in parallel (same priority tier)
3. Define API contracts before frontend/mobile tasks
4. QA review is always the final step
5. Assign separate workspaces to avoid file conflicts

## Workflow

### Step 1: Plan with PM Agent
PM Agent analyzes requirements, selects tech stack, creates task breakdown with priorities.

### Step 2: Spawn Agents by Priority
Guide user to Agent Manager:
1. Open Agent Manager panel (Mission Control)
2. Click 'New Agent', select skill, paste task description
3. Spawn all same-priority tasks in parallel

### Step 3: Monitor & Coordinate
- Watch Agent Manager inbox for questions
- Verify API contracts align between agents
- Ensure shared data models are consistent

### Step 4: QA Review
Spawn QA Agent last to review all deliverables. Address CRITICAL issues by re-spawning agents.

## Automated Alternative
For fully automated execution without manual spawning, use the **orchestrator** skill instead.
